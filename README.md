SourceCred is a tool for communities to measure and reward value creation. Learn

## General Use

We use this repository’s [issues] system to track issues and tasks that don’t
fit in the code and/or website repositories within the project. Project tracking
is done at the organization-wide level; see: [sourcecred/projects]

[issues]: https://github.com/sourcecred/operations/issues
[sourcecred/projects]: https://github.com/orgs/sourcecred/projects

For a more instructive guide on how we do things, see the [SourceCred Operations Manual](/sourcecred/operations/wiki/SourceCred-Operations-Manual).


## Design

In the `design/` directory you can find and store design files, and links to
related resources on hosted design platforms e.g. Figma, Whimsical, etc.

### Figma
We use Figma for visual design, design system, high-fidelity UX wireframes, and
interactive prototypes.

- [SourceCred Design System (WIP)](https://www.figma.com/file/XOZO5sb5W38znlXz9q2mzD/SourceCred-Design-System)
- [SC Project Instance: Dashboard wireframes](https://www.figma.com/file/G3HeipCCQCjA4tg4fdOFdj/SourceCred-Project-Instance-Dashboard?node-id=0%3A1)

### Whimsical
We use Whimsical for flowcharts, quick mockups, site navigation maps, and user journeys.

- [SourceCred Workspace on Whimsical](https://whimsical.com/3Z254PDEfcSvThHK2LfKMx)
  - [UX Wireframes](https://whimsical.com/A6EEdJgLwX3K4VTroURP3b)
  - [Site Map](https://whimsical.com/Bz9zK7s2k1HP38RaQmErSp)
- **OUTDATED:** [LB's website site map proposal](https://whimsical.com/2GXs4xGUdGeo6GABqMYsSd) (July 2020)
- **OUTDATED:** [rpp's website site map proposal](https://whimsical.com/JfwiT84VPvX4aw9jg1Kx84) (June 2020)

We have an [open invite to the SourceCred Workspace] which will expire
August 20, 2020. Message us on Discord in the #design channel after that date.

## Project Management

We track larger projects on the @sourcecred organization’s Projects page
([sourcecred/projects]), but tasks must be assigned in a specific repository’s
Issues system (there is no “organization-wide issues” system).

This `operations` repository is used for all Issues that do not clearly belong
in any of the specific purpose-oriented repositories, such as [@sourcecred/docs]
or [@sourcecred/template-instance].

[@sourcecred/docs]: https://github.com/sourcecred/docs
[@sourcecred/template-instance]: https://github.com/sourcecred/template-instance

See open tasks on our [Issues page].

[Issues page]: https://github.com/sourcecred/operations/issues


## Art / Creative

Creative work that is not primarily focused on user interface-related work, such
as UX wireframes, visual UI, or design system material, should go in the `art/`
directory of this repository.
